    <p style="font-size:x-large;">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
    in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

    <p style="opacity: 70%;font-size:large;">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
    the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

    <span style="opacity:50%;">Verified Graduate</span></p>

    <p style="font-size:x-large;">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>

    <p style="opacity:70%;font-size:large;">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
    for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

    <span style="opacity:50%;">Verified Graduate</span></p>

    <p style="font-size:x-large;">An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</p>

    <p style="opacity: 70%;font-size:large;">‚Äú Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living 
    while doing something I love. ‚Äù</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Patrick">
    <img style="border: solid 3px hsl(263, 55%, 52%)" src="images\image-patrick.jpg" alt="picture of Patrick">

    <span style="opacity: 50%;">Verified Graduate</span></p>

    <p style="font-size:x-large;">Awesome teaching support from TAs who <br>did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them <br>and 
    learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

    <p style="opacity: 70%; font-size:large;">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

    <p style="font-size:x-large;font-size:x-large;">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
    

    <p style="opacity: 70%;font-size:large;">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
    100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
